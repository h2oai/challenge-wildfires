# H2O Olympics | Wildfire Challenge Starter Kit

Welcome to the Wildfire Challenge starter kit. This H2O Wave app is an example of a core AI app for the **H2O.ai Wildfire Challenge**. It serves as an example of how to quickly and easily build **interactive AI applications using H2O Wave**. The app loads a pertained LightGBM model and comes with a default dataset, *Australia Fire Prediction*, from NASA FIRMS - Fire Information for Resource Management System.

With this app you can view at a part of the dataset and graphical representations using a scatter plot on a map. And the pertained model lets you make real-time predictions on test data within the app.

The starter kit Wave app provides all the elements of a H2O Wave app in one place, along with the source code, convenience commands and the training notebooks. It aims to accelerate your AI app development for your solution to the H2O Olympics Wildfire Challenge.

Checkout the source code and other useful elements on the [Challenge Wildfires GitHub repo](https://github.com/h2oai/challenge-wildfires).

Below is a short intro video that walks you through the Wave app:
