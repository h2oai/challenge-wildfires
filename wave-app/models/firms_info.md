### NASA FIRMS - Fire Information for Resource Management System
FIRMS distributes Near Real-Time (NRT) active fire data within 3 hours of satellite observation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ([VIIRS](https://www.jpss.noaa.gov/viirs.html)) aboard S-NPP and NOAA 20.

The raw archive fire/hotspot datasets could be requested at 
https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/ in yearly chunks for each instrument.
* MODIS Collection 6.1: Temporal Coverage: 11 November 2000 - present
* VIIRS S-NPP 375m: Temporal Coverage: 20 January 2012 - present
* VIIRS NOAA-20 375m: Temporal Coverage: 1 January 2020 - present
