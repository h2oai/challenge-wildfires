### NASA FIRMS - Fire Information for Resource Management System
FIRMS distributes Near Real-Time (NRT) active fire data within 3 hours of satellite observation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ([VIIRS](https://www.jpss.noaa.gov/viirs.html)) aboard S-NPP and NOAA 20.

The raw archive fire/hotspot datasets could be requested at 
https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/ in yearly chunks for each instrument.
* MODIS Collection 6.1: Temporal Coverage: 11 November 2000 - present
* VIIRS S-NPP 375m: Temporal Coverage: 20 January 2012 - present
* VIIRS NOAA-20 375m: Temporal Coverage: 1 January 2020 - present

For all the data preparation steps please check our [Notebook](https://github.com/h2oai/challenge-wildfires/blob/main/notebook/DataPreparation.ipynb).

BUSHFIRE_INFO = '''
### 2019â€“20 Australian bushfire season
From September 2019 until March 2020, when the final fire was extinguished, Australia had one of the worst bush fire seasons in its recorded history.
As it can be seen from the satellite dataset New South Wales and Victoria have been worst affected.
More than five million hectares, destroying more than 2,400 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere.
